## **Overview**

This project presents a security-focused **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)** tool designed to detect vulnerabilities in Python source code. The system performs automated static analysis to identify insecure coding patterns, enforce secure coding standards, and map findings to industry security frameworks such as **OWASP Top 10**, **CWE**, and **MITRE ATT&CK**. The tool generates structured reports highlighting severity levels, mitigation suggestions, and evidence for each detected vulnerability. By integrating directly into the development workflow, it strengthens defensive security measures and reduces the risk of exploitable code reaching production environments.

## **Problem Statement**

Many developers inadvertently introduce security vulnerabilities, including insecure input handling, weak cryptographic implementation, and improper validation. Traditional code reviews are time-consuming and error-prone, often failing to catch critical security issues. There is a pressing need for an automated, ethical, and safe mechanism to detect such vulnerabilities during development, provide actionable guidance, and enforce secure coding practices.

## **Objectives**

**General Objective:**
To develop a security-focused static analysis assistant that automatically identifies vulnerabilities and strengthens the security posture of software during development.

**Specific Objectives:**

1. Implement static code analysis techniques to detect common security vulnerabilities in Python code.
2. Map detected issues to **OWASP Top 10**, **CWE**, and **MITRE ATT&CK** for standard-based reporting.
3. Generate structured security reports with severity classification and mitigation guidance.
4. Provide a secure, ethical, and reproducible testing environment.
5. Evaluate the tool’s accuracy, reliability, and usability in a controlled lab setting.

## **Scope of Study**

* **Language Focus:** Python.
* **Security Focus:** Detection of vulnerabilities via static analysis (SAST).
* **Exclusions:** Dynamic analysis, actual exploitation, or hacking of live systems.
* **Environment:** Fully isolated lab setup on virtual machines (Ubuntu/Kali Linux).
* **Deliverables:** Analysis results, security reports, logs, screenshots, and optional CLI/GUI interface.

## **Methodology**

1. **Security Workflow:**

   * Input Python source code
   * Run static analysis using **Bandit, Pylint, Flake8**
   * Identify insecure patterns, vulnerabilities, and rule violations
   * Classify findings by severity and map to standard frameworks

2. **Threat Modeling:**

   * STRIDE-based threat assessment
   * OWASP Top 10 mapping
   * Attack surface identification

3. **Evidence Collection:**

   * Logs, screenshots, JSON/CSV reports
   * Structured reporting with severity levels

4. **Tools & Platforms:**

   * Python (3.x)
   * Bandit, Pylint, Flake8, AutoPEP8
   * Ubuntu / Kali Linux VMs
   * Optional CLI/GUI for demonstration

---

## **Expected Outcomes**

* A fully functional **Secure Code Review Assistant** capable of detecting security flaws in Python code.
* Detailed security reports with evidence, severity classification, and mitigation recommendations.
* Strengthened secure coding practices among developers.
* A live demonstration-ready system suitable for FYP presentation and evaluation.
