# Advance / Scenario
# Write a program to reverse the lines in a file (last line becomes first, etc).

# # made the file lines.txt
# with open("lines.txt", 'w') as f:
#     pass

# with open("lines.txt", 'a') as f:
#     f.write("\nIt's not stopping me lol")
# now we have text in the file lines.txt

# reversing how to do that.
# maybe we take the lines as list and then make the list change the text order and then paste back that to the file.

with open("source.txt", "r") as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
    print(lines)

lines.reverse()

with open("destination.txt", "w", encoding="UTF-8") as f:
    content = f.writelines(lines)
    # print(content)

# with open("source.txt", "a") as f:
#     f.write("\npraise the fool")
